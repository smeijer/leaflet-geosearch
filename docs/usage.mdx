# Usage

There are two ways in which `leaflet-geosearch` can be used. Direct usage, for example for address forms, or embedded in a leaflet map to search for points of interest.

## Using the providers directly

All providers can be used without leaflet. You might want to bind them to a form;

<Playground>
  <Search provider="OpenStreetMap" />
</Playground>

```js
import { OpenStreetMapProvider } from 'leaflet-geosearch';

const provider = new OpenStreetMapProvider();
const results = await provider.search({ query: input.value });
```

## Using the leaflet control

Or add the `GeoSearchControl` to the leaflet map instance, to render a search control on your map;

See [Leaflet Control](/leaflet-control) for more info about the the options this control provides.

<Playground>
  <Map provider="OpenStreetMap" />
</Playground>

```js
import { GeoSearchControl, OpenStreetMapProvider } from 'leaflet-geosearch';

const searchControl = new GeoSearchControl({
  provider: new OpenStreetMapProvider(),
});

map.addControl(searchControl);
```

## Results

The search event of all providers return an array of `result` objects. The base structure is uniform between the providers. It contains objects matching the following interface:

```ts
interface result {
  x: number; // lon
  y: number; // lat
  label: string; // formatted address
  bounds: [
    [number, number], // south, west - lat, lon
    [number, number], // north, east - lat, lon
  ];
  raw: any; // raw provider result
}
```
