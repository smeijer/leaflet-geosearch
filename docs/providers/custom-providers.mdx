# Custom Providers

It's possible to create your own providers either by creating one from scratch, or extending an existing one.

The most trivial one to extend, is the [OpenStreetMap][1] provider. As Nominatim is open source, and can be self hosted, the provider allows for easy extension.

```js
import { OpenStreetMapProvider } from 'leaflet-geosearch';

class MyProvider extends OpenStreetMapProvider {
  constructor(options) {
    super({
      ...options,
      searchUrl: 'https://example.com/api/search',
      reverseUrl: 'https://example.com/api/reverse',
    });
  }
}
```

When the constructor is the only thing you need to override, it might be sufficient to provide the options during initialization:

```js
const provider = new OpenStreetMapProvider({
  searchUrl: 'https://example.com/api/search',
  reverseUrl: 'https://example.com/api/reverse',
});
```

However, custom providers can be easier to share, and have a single source of truth. As you don't need to manage the URL's on various places throughout your codebase.

## Custom Server Response

When you need to adjust the provider to support a different json data shape, you might want to override more than just the urls.

The`parse` method allows you to transform the server response, to the SearchResult types.

The `endpoint` method is there to select the correct endpoint, based on the search parameters.

```js
import { JsonProvider } from 'leaflet-geosearch';

class MyProvider extends JsonProvider {
  endpoint({ query, type }) {
    // Result: https://example.com/api/search?q=some%20address&f=json
    return this.getUrl('https://example.com/api/search', {
      q: query,
      f: 'json',
    });
  }

  parse({ data }) {
    // Note that `data` is the raw result returned by the server. This
    // method should return data in the SearchResult format.
    return data.map(x => ({
      x: data.x,
      y: data.y,
      label: data.label,
      bounds: data.bounds,
    }));
  }
}
```

## Sharing
When you've build a custom provider that can be used by others, please consider opening a [pull-request][2], or publishing it to `npm`.
